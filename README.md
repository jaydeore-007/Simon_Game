# Simon_Game
Simon game is a popular electronic game that challenges players to remember and repeat increasingly complex sequences of lights and sounds. It consists of a small electronic device with four colored buttons, each of which corresponds to a different tone. The game randomly plays a sequence of colors and tones, and the player must repeat the pattern by pressing the buttons in the same order. With each successful round, the pattern becomes longer and more challenging, testing the player's memory and concentration. The game continues until the player makes a mistake, and their score is recorded. Simon game is a fun and challenging way to improve your memory and sharpen your focus. It is suitable for all ages and can be played alone or with friends.
